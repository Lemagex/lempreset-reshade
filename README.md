## Download

## Setup
Copy reshade-presets and reshade-shaders to your game directory to ensure you have the correct versions of shaders required to use these presets!!!! If you already have the shader files, please select SKIP and not REPLACE as yours may be more up to date!

## Selecting Profile In-game
All my profiles will be stored in your presets folder under >Lemage
Please select them there!

These presets were designed for RESHADE but they may or may not work on other #SHADE forks.

Enjoy!
