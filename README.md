## Pre Requisites
Reshade, obviously. Head over to [their download page](https://reshade.me/#download)
Be sure to download the one labelled "with full addon support" 
Follow the prompts, it's a well made installer and will guide you well. You can even download my preset first and feed it into the installer for it to download only the shaders required. Otherwise, if you plan on using it with other presets, you should just grab it all.

## Download
Please head to the [latest release](https://github.com/Lemagex/lempreset-reshade/releases/latest).

## Setup
Copy reshade-presets to your game directory.
I also recommend using [this plugin](https://github.com/4lex4nder/ReshadeEffectShaderToggler-FFXIV_UIONLY) to keep your UI untouched.

## Selecting Profile In-game
All my profiles will be stored in your presets folder under >Lemage
Please select them there!

These presets were designed for RESHADE but they may or may not work on other #SHADE forks.

Enjoy!

## FAQ
My game is super dark!
You're using Gshade ported shaders or other non-standard replacements for Reshade's shaders. Please only use the ones provided by the Reshade installer when selecting my preset. Sorry.
