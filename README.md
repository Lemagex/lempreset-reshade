Just my presets for Reshade usage. These are gameplay focused.
I hope you enjoy them as much as I do :)

## Download
Please head to the [latest release](https://github.com/Lemagex/lempreset-reshade/releases/latest).

## Setup
Copy reshade-presets to your game directory.
I also recommend using [this plugin](https://github.com/4lex4nder/ReshadeEffectShaderToggler-FFXIV_UIONLY) to keep your UI untouched.

## Selecting Profile In-game
All my profiles will be stored in your presets folder under >Lemage
Please select them there!

These presets were designed for RESHADE but they may or may not work on other #SHADE forks.

Enjoy!
